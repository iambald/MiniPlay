## MiniPlay for Google Play Music
[MiniPlay](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/miniplay/dfddfiedihbijfeacjamchlliogmjjnd) adds a miniplayer and global keyboard shortcuts to [Google Play Music](https://play.google.com/music/listen).

Note: You need to have a Google Play Music account to use this extension. After installing the extension, you will have to refresh your Google Play Music tab due to a Chrome extension limitation.

### Features

- Control playback from a popup
- Global (Chrome-wide) shortcuts
- Rich notifications
- Last.fm scrobbling

The extension does not collect any information, but requires access to your other tabs for functionality.
